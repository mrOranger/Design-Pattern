# ABSTRACT FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN
The **Abstact Factory** is a creational Design Pattern used to separate the instantiation of objects based on the same family type. Differently to the **Factory** Design Pattern, the concrete Factory through instantiate an object, is defined using an interface, in this way, we use the interface to define the methods that will return different objects based on a parameter.
We can apply the pattern to abstract how the objects are instantiated, how a system is configurated, and to provide a library through are defined classes and interfaces hiding the implementations.
