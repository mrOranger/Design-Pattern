# OBSERVER DESIGN PATTERN
The Observer Design Patter is an **Architectural** design patter used to manage many event-based systems.
The pattern is based on two elements: the **Subject** that defines the way to register or unregister a new element and to notify all the changes to the **Observers**.
An **Observers** is an element registerd on the Subject and to which we can perform the update of its status. 
Many operating systems are based on this pattern, to manage the driven-event mechanisms.
