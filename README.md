# DESIGN PATTERN
The Design Pattern are software solutions to common design and programming problems.
The most well knowed Design Patterns are those identified by the Gang Of Four.
We can identify the Design Pattern in three categories:
Creational Design Pattern that solve problems about the instantiation of objects.
Structural Design Pattern that solve problems about the classes and objects' structures.
Behavioural Design Pattern that solve problems about the objects' interaction.
