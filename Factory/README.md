# FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN
The **Factory** Design Pattern is a __Creational Design Pattern__ used abstracting the concept of instantiation of an object, giving to an interface the duty to decide which object instantiate.
The Pattern is used because sometime the instantiation of an object requires complex processes and the duplication of code, without giving a correct level of abstraction. 
The pattern can be used when the life-cycle management of an object must be centralized, in order to ensure a correct behaviour of the application.
