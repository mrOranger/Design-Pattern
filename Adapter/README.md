# ADAPTER DESIGN PATTERN
The __Adapter Design Pattern__ allows us to use a class defined to a specific interface as it has been defined with another interface.
The pattern is composed by these elements:
__Target__ interface that defines how the elements should behave.
__Adapter__ is the class that converts the behaviour of the __Adaptee__ class in the __Target__ class.
__Adaptee__ is the class whose behavious must be converted.
